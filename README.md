## Description

`Noll책tta` is a hybrid theme combined from excellent [Light Delight](https://github.com/DNonov/lightDelight) and [Nord Deep](https://github.com/marlosirapuan/vscode-theme-nord-deep).

Syntax highlighting and workbench styles (with very minor changes) were taken from `Light Delight` while terminal colors are direcrtly copied from `Nord Deep`. This move is rather induced by many console applications obusing colors usage in pursuit of more usability and as resulting in quite opposite experience if terminal uses light background.  

## Name

`Noll책tta` means `08` (zero-eight) in Swedish. This is rather not nice nickname for people from Stockholm, based on telephone code of the region.
