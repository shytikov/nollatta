## Description

`Noll친tta` is a hybrid theme combined from excellent [Light Delight](https://github.com/DNonov/lightDelight) and [Nord Deep](https://github.com/marlosirapuan/vscode-theme-nord-deep).

Syntax highlighting and workbench styles (with very minor changes) were taken from `Light Delight` while terminal colors are direcrtly copied from `Nord Deep`. This move is rather induced by many console applications obusing colors usage in pursuit for more usability. And resulting in quite an opposite experience if terminal uses light background. I have tried fixing these issues on per application basis, and predictably failed. So I opted for dark terminal all the way. 

## Name

`Noll친tta` means `08` (zero-eight) in Swedish. This is rather not nice nickname for people from Stockholm, based on telephone code of the region. Noll친ttas are very fancy and practical in the same time, and combine these qualities in somewhat ridiculous manner. Like this color theme 游뱌
