## Description

`Noll친tta` is a hybrid theme combined from excellent [Light Delight](https://github.com/DNonov/lightDelight) and [Nord Deep](https://github.com/marlosirapuan/vscode-theme-nord-deep). Some inspiration on syntax highlighting was taken from [GitHub Light Monochrome](https://github.com/huytd/vscode-github-light-monochrome) and the colors are mostly from [Android Code Search](https://cs.android.com/).

The theme combiles light syntax highlighting and workbench styles with dark terminal colors. This move is rather induced by many console applications obusing colors usage in pursuit for more usability. And resulting in quite an opposite experience if terminal uses light background. I have tried fixing these issues on per application basis, and predictably failed. So I opted for dark terminal all the way. 

## Name

`Noll친tta` means `08` (zero-eight) in Swedish. This is rather ironic nickname for people from Stockholm, based on telephone code of the region. "Noll친ttas" are very fancy and practical in the same time, also they combine these traits in somewhat ridiculous manner. Like this color theme 游뱌

## Borrowed (stolen)

* Workbench colors are directly taken from `Light Delight`;
* Terminal colors are directly taken from `Nord Deep`;
* Keywords in monochrome and bold came from `GitHub Light Monochrome`;
* Majority of syntax highlighting colors are from `Android Code Search`;
